# HKUST ECEFYP [ZW01a_23] Hardware acceleration for data processing
This project aims to provide a purpose-designed hardware accelerator on FPGA to accelerate image processing algorithms such as desnoising, edge detectiona and color-to-grayscale methods and provide a high-performance, efficient and flexible design and implementation for such purposes.
